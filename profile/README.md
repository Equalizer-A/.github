## 🧠 Overview

**Equalizer APO** is a powerful system-wide audio processing engine for Windows that allows precise control over sound output. It works at a low level in the audio stack, applying equalization and filters to all audio passing through selected devices.

Unlike traditional media-player equalizers, Equalizer APO affects the entire system, making it ideal for headphones, speakers, and professional audio setups. Users can shape frequency response, correct acoustic issues, and fine-tune sound characteristics with high accuracy.

The software is lightweight, efficient, and designed for stability. Configuration is handled through text-based profiles or graphical front-ends, allowing both advanced users and beginners to customize audio behavior according to their needs.

Optimized for Windows systems, Equalizer APO runs in the background with minimal resource usage, providing consistent and reliable audio processing for everyday listening, gaming, and professional audio work.
